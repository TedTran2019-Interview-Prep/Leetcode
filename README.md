I didn't record any information about the problems I've done. It would be ideal
to classify problems and note how they were solved.

### Hash Table
- Two Sum: Check Hashmap for complement

### Array
- Remove Duplicates: Swap placeholder for greater value
  - Plan before execution
- Remove Element: Swap placeholder for non-target
  - More or less, both remove problems just involve keeping track of two indices
- Plus One: Iterate backwards, unshift, and either logic or mod/divide.
- Merge: Using an array to hold values in sorted order until they're ready to be inserted
  - A better solution is to iterate backwards, placing the largest values in nums1.
- Pascal's Triangle: Just code the generation logic.
- Pascal's Triangle II: N/A
- Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock: Compare current lowest price with future prices until new lowest price is found, keeping track of highest profit.

### String
- Roman to Integer: Utilize a hashmap, and add or subtract value depending on next symbol

### Linked List
- Add Two Numbers: Div, mod, and carries
  - The cleanup for this one is really nice since no value can be changed to 0
- Merge Two Sorted Lists: Linked List understanding/knowledge.

### Binary Search
- Search Insert: Just binary search, but return low if not found

### Binary Search Tree
- Sorted Array to BST: Recursive solution that ensures every tree is a BST

### Bitwise Operations
- Single Number: Xor
