I didn't record any information about the problems I've done. It would be ideal
to classify problems and note how they were solved.

### Hash Table
- Two Sum: Check Hashmap for complement

### Array
- Remove Duplicates: Swap placeholder for greater value
  - Plan before execution
- Remove Element: Swap placeholder for non-target
  - More or less, both remove problems just involve keeping track of two indices
- Plus One: Iterate backwards, unshift, and either logic or mod/divide.
- Merge: Using an array to hold values in sorted order until they're ready to be inserted

### Linked List
- Add Two Numbers: Div, mod, and carries
  - The cleanup for this one is really nice since no value can be changed to 0

### Binary Search
- Search Insert: Just binary search, but return low if not found
